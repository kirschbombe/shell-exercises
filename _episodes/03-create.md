> ## Renaming Files
>
> Suppose that you created a `.txt` file in your current directory to contain a list of the
> statistical tests you will need to do to analyze your data, and named it: `statstics.txt`
>
> After creating and saving this file you realize you misspelled the filename! You want to
> correct the mistake, which of the following commands could you use to do so?
>
> 1. `cp statstics.txt statistics.txt`
> 2. `mv statstics.txt statistics.txt`
> 3. `mv statstics.txt .`
> 4. `cp statstics.txt .`
>
> > ## Solution
> > 1. No.  While this would create a file with the correct name, the incorrectly named file still exists in the directory
> > and would need to be deleted.
> > 2. Yes, this would work to rename the file.
> > 3. No, the period(.) indicates where to move the file, but does not provide a new file name; identical file names
> > cannot be created.
> > 4. No, the period(.) indicates where to copy the file, but does not provide a new file name; identical file names
> > cannot be created.

> ## Moving and Copying
>
> What is the output of the closing `ls` command in the sequence shown below?
>
> ~~~
> $ pwd
> ~~~
> {: .bash}
> ~~~
> /Users/jamie/data
> ~~~
> {: .output}
> ~~~
> $ ls
> ~~~
> {: .bash}
> ~~~
> proteins.dat
> ~~~
> {: .output}
> ~~~
> $ mkdir recombine
> $ mv proteins.dat recombine
> $ cp recombine/proteins.dat ../proteins-saved.dat
> $ ls
> ~~~
> {: .bash}
>
> 1.   `proteins-saved.dat recombine`
> 2.   `recombine`
> 3.   `proteins.dat recombine`
> 4.   `proteins-saved.dat`
>
> > ## Solution
> > We start in the `/Users/jamie/data` directory, and create a new folder called `recombine`.
> > The second line moves (`mv`) the file `proteins.dat` to the new folder (`recombine`).
> > The third line makes a copy of the file we just moved.  The tricky part here is where the file was
> > copied to.  Recall that `..` means "go up a level", so the copied file is now in `/Users/jamie`.
> > Notice that `..` is interpreted with respect to the current working
> > directory, **not** with respect to the location of the file being copied.
> > So, the only thing that will show using ls (in `/Users/jamie/data`) is the recombine folder.
> >
> > 1. No, see explanation above.  `proteins-saved.dat` is located at `/Users/jamie`
> > 2. Yes
> > 3. No, see explanation above.  `proteins.dat` is located at `/Users/jamie/data/recombine`
> > 4. No, see explanation above.  `proteins-saved.dat` is located at `/Users/jamie`

> ## Organizing Directories and Files
>
> Jamie is working on a project and she sees that her files aren't very well
> organized:
>
> ~~~
> $ ls -F
> ~~~
> {: .bash}
> ~~~
> analyzed/  fructose.dat    raw/   sucrose.dat
> ~~~
> {: .output}
>
> The `fructose.dat` and `sucrose.dat` files contain output from her data
> analysis. What command(s) covered in this lesson does she need to run so that the commands below will
> produce the output shown?
>
> ~~~
> $ ls -F
> ~~~
> {: .bash}
> ~~~
> analyzed/   raw/
> ~~~
> {: .output}
> ~~~
> $ ls analyzed
> ~~~
> {: .bash}
> ~~~
> fructose.dat    sucrose.dat
> ~~~
> {: .output}
>
> > ## Solution
> > ```
> > mv *.dat analyzed
> > ```
> > {: .bash}
> > Jamie needs to move her files `fructose.dat` and `sucrose.dat` to the `analyzed` directory.
> > The shell will expand *.dat to match all .dat files in the current directory.
> > The `mv` command then moves the list of .dat files to the "analyzed" directory.

> ## Copy with Multiple Filenames
>
> For this exercise, you can test the commands in the `data-shell/data directory`.
>
> In the example below, what does `cp` do when given several filenames and a directory name?
>
> ~~~
> $ mkdir backup
> $ cp amino-acids.txt animals.txt backup/
> ~~~
> {: .bash}
>
> In the example below, what does `cp` do when given three or more file names?
>
> ~~~
> $ ls -F
> ~~~
> {: .bash}
> ~~~
> amino-acids.txt  animals.txt  backup/  elements/  morse.txt  pdb/  planets.txt  salmon.txt  sunspot.txt
> ~~~
> {: .output}
> ~~~
> $ cp amino-acids.txt animals.txt morse.txt
> ~~~
> {: .bash}
>
> > ## Solution
> > If given more than one file name followed by a directory name (i.e. the destination directory must
> > be the last argument), `cp` copies the files to the named directory.
> >
> > If given three file names, `cp` throws an error because it is expecting a directory
> > name as the last argument.
> >
> > ```
> > cp: target ‘morse.txt’ is not a directory
> > ```

> ## Listing Recursively and By Time
>
> The command `ls -R` lists the contents of directories recursively,
> i.e., lists their sub-directories, sub-sub-directories, and so on
> in alphabetical order at each level.
> The command `ls -t` lists things by time of last change,
> with most recently changed files or directories first.
> In what order does `ls -R -t` display things?
> > ## Solution
> > The command `ls -R -t` displays the directories recursively in
> > chronological order at each level, and the files in each directory
> > are displayed chronologically.

> ## Creating Files a Different Way
>
> We have seen how to create text files using the `nano` editor.
> Now, try the following command in your home directory:
>
> ~~~
> $ cd                  # go to your home directory
> $ touch my_file.txt
> ~~~
> {: .bash}
>
> 1.  What did the touch command do?
>     When you look at your home directory using the GUI file explorer,
>     does the file show up?
>
> 2.  Use `ls -l` to inspect the files.  How large is `my_file.txt`?
>
> 3.  When might you want to create a file this way?
>
> > ## Solution
> > 1.  The touch command generates a new file called 'my_file.txt' in
> >     your home directory.  If you are in your home directory, you
> >     can observe this newly generated file by typing 'ls' at the
> >     command line prompt.  'my_file.txt' can also be viewed in your
> >     GUI file explorer.
> >
> > 2.  When you inspect the file with 'ls -l', note that the size of
> >     'my_file.txt' is 0kb.  In other words, it contains no data.
> >     If you open 'my_file.txt' using your text editor it is blank.
> >
> > 3.  Some programs do not generate output files themselves, but
> >     instead require that empty files have already been generated.
> >     When the program is run, it searches for an existing file to
> >     populate with its output.  The touch command allows you to
> >     efficiently generate a blank text file to be used by such
> >     programs.

> ## Moving to the Current Folder
>
> After running the following commands,
> Jamie realizes that she put the files `sucrose.dat` and `maltose.dat` into the wrong folder:
>
> ~~~
> $ ls -F
> raw/ analyzed/
> $ ls -F analyzed
> fructose.dat glucose.dat maltose.dat sucrose.dat
> $ cd raw/
> ~~~
> {: .bash}
>
> Fill in the blanks to move these files to the current folder
> (i.e., the one she is currently in):
>
> ~~~
> $ mv ___/sucrose.dat  ___/maltose.dat ___
> ~~~
> {: .bash}
> > ## Solution
> > ```
> > $ mv ../analyzed/sucrose.dat ../analyzed/maltose.dat .
> > ```
> > {: .bash}
> > Recall that `..` refers to the parent directory (i.e. one above the current directory)
> > and that `.` refers to the current directory.

> ## Using `rm` Safely
>
> What happens when we type `rm -i thesis/quotations.txt`?
> Why would we want this protection when using `rm`?
>
> > ## Solution
> > ```
> > $ rm: remove regular file 'thesis/quotations.txt'?
> > ```
> > {: .bash}
> > The -i option will prompt before every removal.
> > The Unix shell doesn't have a trash bin, so all the files removed will disappear forever.
> > By using the -i flag, we have the chance to check that we are deleting only the files that we want to remove.

> ## Copy a folder structure sans files
>
> You're starting a new experiment, and would like to duplicate the file
> structure from your previous experiment without the data files so you can
> add new data.
>
> Assume that the file structure is in a folder called '2016-05-18-data',
> which contains folders named 'raw' and 'processed' that contain data files.
> The goal is to copy the file structure of the `2016-05-18-data` folder
> into a folder called `2016-05-20-data` and remove the data files from
> the directory you just created.
>
> Which of the following set of commands would achieve this objective?
> What would the other commands do?
>
> ~~~
> $ cp -r 2016-05-18-data/ 2016-05-20-data/
> $ rm 2016-05-20-data/raw/*
> $ rm 2016-05-20-data/processed/*
> ~~~
> {: .bash}
> ~~~
> $ rm 2016-05-20-data/raw/*
> $ rm 2016-05-20-data/processed/*
> $ cp -r 2016-05-18-data/ 2016-5-20-data/
> ~~~
> {: .bash}
> ~~~
> $ cp -r 2016-05-18-data/ 2016-05-20-data/
> $ rm -r -i 2016-05-20-data/
> ~~~
> {: .bash}
> >
> > ## Solution
> > The first set of commands achieves this objective.
> > First we have a recursive copy of a data folder.
> > Then two `rm` commands which remove all files in the specified directories.
> > The shell expands the '*' wild card to match all files and subdirectories.
> >
> > The second set of commands have the wrong order:
> > attempting to delete files which haven't yet been copied,
> > followed by the recursive copy command which would copy them.
> >
> > The third set of commands would achieve the objective, but in a time-consuming way:
> > the first command copies the directory recursively, but the second command deletes
> > interactively, prompting for confirmation for each file and directory.
