> ## Absolute vs Relative Paths
>
> Starting from `/Users/amanda/data/`,
> which of the following commands could Amanda use to navigate to her home directory,
> which is `/Users/amanda`?
>
> 1. `cd .`
> 2. `cd /`
> 3. `cd /home/amanda`
> 4. `cd ../..`
> 5. `cd ~`
> 6. `cd home`
> 7. `cd ~/data/..`
> 8. `cd`
> 9. `cd ..`
>
> > ## Solution
> > 1. No: `.` stands for the current directory.
> > 2. No: `/` stands for the root directory.
> > 3. No: Amanda's home directory is `/Users/amanda`.
> > 4. No: this goes up two levels, i.e. ends in `/Users`.
> > 5. Yes: `~` stands for the user's home directory, in this case `/Users/amanda`.
> > 6. No: this would navigate into a directory `home` in the current directory if it exists.
> > 7. Yes: unnecessarily complicated, but correct.
> > 8. Yes: shortcut to go back to the user's home directory.
> > 9. Yes: goes up one level.

> ## Relative Path Resolution
>
> Using the filesystem diagram below, if `pwd` displays `/Users/thing`,
> what will `ls -F ../backup` display?
>
> 1.  `../backup: No such file or directory`
> 2.  `2012-12-01 2013-01-08 2013-01-27`
> 3.  `2012-12-01/ 2013-01-08/ 2013-01-27/`
> 4.  `original/ pnas_final/ pnas_sub/`
>
> ![File System for Challenge Questions](../fig/filesystem-challenge.svg)
>
> > ## Solution
> > 1. No: there *is* a directory `backup` in `/Users`.
> > 2. No: this is the content of `Users/thing/backup`,
> >    but with `..` we asked for one level further up.
> > 3. No: see previous explanation.
> > 4. Yes: `../backup/` refers to `/Users/backup/`.

> ## `ls` Reading Comprehension
>
> Assuming a directory structure as in the above Figure
> (File System for Challenge Questions), if `pwd` displays `/Users/backup`,
> and `-r` tells `ls` to display things in reverse order,
> what command will display:
>
> ~~~
> pnas_sub/ pnas_final/ original/
> ~~~
> {: .output}
>
> 1.  `ls pwd`
> 2.  `ls -r -F`
> 3.  `ls -r -F /Users/backup`
> 4.  Either #2 or #3 above, but not #1.
>
> > ## Solution
> >  1. No: `pwd` is not the name of a directory.
> >  2. Yes: `ls` without directory argument lists files and directories
> >     in the current directory.
> >  3. Yes: uses the absolute path explicitly.
> >  4. Correct: see explanations above.

> ## Exploring More `ls` Flags
>
> What does the command `ls` do when used with the `-l` and `-h` flags?
>
> Some of its output is about properties that we do not cover in this lesson (such
> as file permissions and ownership), but the rest should be useful
> nevertheless.
>
> > ## Solution
> > The `-l` flag makes `ls` use a **l**ong listing format, showing not only
> > the file/directory names but also additional information such as the file size
> > and the time of its last modification. The `-h` flag makes the file size
> > "**h**uman readable", i.e. display something like `5.3K` instead of `5369`.

> ## Listing Recursively and By Time
>
> The command `ls -R` lists the contents of directories recursively, i.e., lists
> their sub-directories, sub-sub-directories, and so on in alphabetical order
> at each level. The command `ls -t` lists things by time of last change, with
> most recently changed files or directories first.
> In what order does `ls -R -t` display things? Hint: `ls -l` uses a long listing
> format to view timestamps.
>
> > ## Solution
> > The directories are listed alphabetical at each level, the files/directories
> > in each directory are sorted by time of last change.
