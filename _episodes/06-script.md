> ## Variables in Shell Scripts
>
> In the `molecules` directory, imagine you have a shell script called `script.sh` containing the
> following commands:
>
> ~~~
> head -n $2 $1
> tail -n $3 $1
> ~~~
> {: .bash}
>
> While you are in the `molecules` directory, you type the following command:
>
> ~~~
> bash script.sh '*.pdb' 1 1
> ~~~
> {: .bash}
>
> Which of the following outputs would you expect to see?
>
> 1. All of the lines between the first and the last lines of each file ending in `.pdb`
>    in the `molecules` directory
> 2. The first and the last line of each file ending in `.pdb` in the `molecules` directory
> 3. The first and the last line of each file in the `molecules` directory
> 4. An error because of the quotes around `*.pdb`
>
> > ## Solution
> > The correct answer is 2.
> >
> > The special variables $1, $2 and $3 represent the command line arguments given to the
> > script, such that the commands run are:
> >
> > ```
> > $ head -n 1 cubane.pdb ethane.pdb octane.pdb pentane.pdb propane.pdb
> > $ tail -n 1 cubane.pdb ethane.pdb octane.pdb pentane.pdb propane.pdb
> > ```
> > {: .bash}
> > The shell does not expand `'*.pdb'` because it is enclosed by quote marks.
> > As such, the first argument to the script is `'*.pdb'` which gets expanded within the
> > script by `head` and `tail`.

> ## List Unique Species
>
> Leah has several hundred data files, each of which is formatted like this:
>
> ~~~
> 2013-11-05,deer,5
> 2013-11-05,rabbit,22
> 2013-11-05,raccoon,7
> 2013-11-06,rabbit,19
> 2013-11-06,deer,2
> 2013-11-06,fox,1
> 2013-11-07,rabbit,18
> 2013-11-07,bear,1
> ~~~
> {: .source}
>
> An example of this type of file is given in `data-shell/data/animals.txt`.
>
> Write a shell script called `species.sh` that takes any number of
> filenames as command-line arguments, and uses `cut`, `sort`, and
> `uniq` to print a list of the unique species appearing in each of
> those files separately.
>
> > ## Solution
> >
> > ```
> > # Script to find unique species in csv files where species is the second data field
> > # This script accepts any number of file names as command line arguments
> >
> > # Loop over all files
> > for file in $@
> > do
> > 	echo "Unique species in $file:"
> > 	# Extract species names
> > 	cut -d , -f 2 $file | sort | uniq
> > done
> > ```

> ## Find the Longest File With a Given Extension
>
> Write a shell script called `longest.sh` that takes the name of a
> directory and a filename extension as its arguments, and prints
> out the name of the file with the most lines in that directory
> with that extension. For example:
>
> ~~~
> $ bash longest.sh /tmp/data pdb
> ~~~
> {: .bash}
>
> would print the name of the `.pdb` file in `/tmp/data` that has
> the most lines.
>
> > ## Solution
> >
> > ```
> > # Shell script which takes two arguments:
> > #    1. a directory name
> > #    2. a file extension
> > # and prints the name of the file in that directory
> > # with the most lines which matches the file extension.
> >
> > wc -l $1/*.$2 | sort -n | tail -n 2 | head -n 1

> ## Why Record Commands in the History Before Running Them?
>
> If you run the command:
>
> ~~~
> $ history | tail -n 5 > recent.sh
> ~~~
> {: .bash}
>
> the last command in the file is the `history` command itself, i.e.,
> the shell has added `history` to the command log before actually
> running it. In fact, the shell *always* adds commands to the log
> before running them. Why do you think it does this?
>
> > ## Solution
> > If a command causes something to crash or hang, it might be useful
> > to know what that command was, in order to investigate the problem.
> > Were the command only be recorded after running it, we would not
> > have a record of the last command run in the event of a crash.

> ## Script Reading Comprehension
>
> For this question, consider the `data-shell/molecules` directory once again.
> This contains a number of `.pdb` files in addition to any other files you
> may have created.
> Explain what a script called `example.sh` would do when run as
> `bash example.sh *.pdb` if it contained the following lines:
>
> ~~~
> # Script 1
> echo *.*
> ~~~
> {: .bash}
>
> ~~~
> # Script 2
> for filename in $1 $2 $3
> do
>     cat $filename
> done
> ~~~
> {: .bash}
>
> ~~~
> # Script 3
> echo $@.pdb
> ~~~
> {: .bash}
>
> > ## Solutions
> > Script 1 would print out a list of all files containing a dot in their name.
> >
> > Script 2 would print the contents of the first 3 files matching the file extension.
> > The shell expands the wildcard before passing the arguments to the `example.sh` script.
> >
> > Script 3 would print all the arguments to the script (i.e. all the `.pdb` files),
> > followed by `.pdb`.
> > cubane.pdb ethane.pdb methane.pdb octane.pdb pentane.pdb propane.pdb.pdb

> ## Debugging Scripts
>
> Suppose you have saved the following script in a file called `do-errors.sh`
> in Nelle's `north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03` directory:
>
> ~~~
> # Calculate reduced stats for data files at J = 100 c/bp.
> for datafile in "$@"
> do
>     echo $datfile
>     bash goostats -J 100 -r $datafile stats-$datafile
> done
> ~~~
> {: .bash}
>
> When you run it:
>
> ~~~
> $ bash do-errors.sh *[AB].txt
> ~~~
> {: .bash}
>
> the output is blank.
> To figure out why, re-run the script using the `-x` option:
>
> ~~~
> bash -x do-errors.sh *[AB].txt
> ~~~
> {: .bash}
>
> What is the output showing you?
> Which line is responsible for the error?
>
> > ## Solution
> > The `-x` flag causes `bash` to run in debug mode.
> > This prints out each command as it is run, which will help you to locate errors.
> > In this example, we can see that `echo` isn't printing anything. We have made a typo
> > in the loop variable name, and the variable `datfile` doesn't exist, hence returning
> > an empty string.
